Example step
============
Create a THREEJS scene

Goal
====
Understand how THREEJS relates to HTML and the Canvas

Prerequisites
=============
Some prerequisites required to understand this (and next) chapters:
+ Element of HTML pages
+ Basis of JavaScript language

Instructions
============
Write a simple HTML page with a div named "theContainer".
Then, using Javascript:
+   retrieve your container with {% endhighlight %}document.getElementById(id){% endhighlight %}
+   create new renderer with 

{% highlight javascript %}
new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
{% endhighlight %}

+   add CSS (size, border or background) to the webgl canvas and/or add more HTML elements

Explanation
===========
The scene is basically composed by the camera, the renderer and the scene object. But of course, it is an empty scene and is not being rendered yet. Let's see what is missing!

Concept: [creating a scene](http://threejs.org/docs/#Manual/Introduction/Creating_a_scene).

Working with: [THREE.WebGLRenderer](http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Renderers/WebGLRenderer), [THREE.Scene](http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Scenes/Scene), [THREE.Camera](http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Cameras/Camera).

Deeper: 
+ [CanvasRenderer](http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Renderers/CanvasRenderer)
+ [Camera Math](http://ksimek.github.io/2013/08/13/intrinsic/)
